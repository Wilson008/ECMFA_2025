To create an instance of your DSL that follows `Grammar 2` based on the changes from `Grammar 1`, we need to address the differences between the grammars. Here are the key changes noted between the two grammar versions:

1. **Modifier** has been replaced by **Validator** in `Grammar 2`. This means wherever there were Modifier definitions, they should now be Validators.

2. **Validator** references replace **Modifier** references in methods with a keyword change from `'modifiers:'` to `'validators:'`.

3. Introduction of `DataStore` is a new rule but optional, so we will not instantiate it as per the given instructions.

Using these differences, we will modify `Instance 1` to derive `Instance 2` that aligns with `Grammar 2`. Here is what that updated instance would look like:

```plaintext
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

This new instance reflects the changes by renaming `Modifier` to `Validator` and updating the associated keywords in the method definition. Other aspects of the DSL, like any `DataStore` definitions, are not instantiated because they are new and optional features according to your instructions.
