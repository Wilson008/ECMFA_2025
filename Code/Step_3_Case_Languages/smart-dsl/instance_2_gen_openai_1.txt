To migrate `Instance 1` from `Grammar 1` to `Grammar 2`, we need to understand the changes made between the two grammars:

1. **New Rule Added**: 
   - `Validator` has been added, replacing `Modifier` in the method definition. However, this rule is in an "optional" position in the method definition, so it does not need immediate instantiation.
   
2. **Terminology Changes**:
   - `Modifier` has been renamed to `Validator` in the method, but `Modifier` is still a separate entity in `Grammar 1` and `Validator` in `Grammar 2`.

3. **New Rule Added**:
   - `DataStore` was added to `Grammar 2` as an optional entity.

Following these differences, here is `Instance 2`, based on `Instance 1` and updated according to `Grammar 2`:

```plaintext
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

Key Points:
- Replaced `Modifier` with `validator` to align with the name change in `Grammar 2`.
- Reflect this change in the `method` rule as well, updating `modifiers` to `validators`.
- We have not instantiated any optional new rules or attributes from `Grammar 2` (e.g., `dataStores`, `DataStore`), as per your instructions.
