=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences between the grammars and modify instance_1 to conform to grammar_2. The key changes needed are:

1. `Modifier` keyword changed to `validator`
2. `modifiers:` keyword changed to `validators:`

The new `DataStore` rule is optional (it's in an OR relationship in the Contract rule), so following guideline #2, I won't add any DataStore instances.

Here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

The changes made were:
1. Changed `Modifier` to `validator` for the two validator definitions
2. Changed `modifiers:` to `validators:` in the method definition

All other formatting, including whitespace, indentation, and empty lines, remains exactly the same as in instance_1.
