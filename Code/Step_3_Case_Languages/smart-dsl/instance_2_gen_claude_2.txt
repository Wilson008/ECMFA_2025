=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and evolve instance_1 to instance_2 following your guidelines.

Main changes needed:
1. "Modifier" keyword needs to change to "validator"
2. "modifiers:" keyword needs to change to "validators:"
3. The DataStore rule is new but optional (part of OR relationship in Contract rule), so we won't add it

Here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

        Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}

The changes made are:
1. Changed "Modifier" to "validator" in both declarations
2. Changed "modifiers:" to "validators:" in the method declaration

I maintained all formatting, including:
- All white spaces
- All indentations
- All empty lines
- All line breaks
- All existing content structure

I didn't add any DataStore instances since it's optional in grammar_2.
