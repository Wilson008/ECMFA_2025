To modify Instance 1 to conform to Grammar 2, we need to consider the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2. Let's first summarize the changes:

1. **Modifier to Validator**: 
   - The `Modifier` grammar rule in Grammar 1 has been replaced with `Validator` in Grammar 2. This change affects both the definition and usage within the `Method`.

2. **New Grammar Rule: `DataStore`**:
   - Grammar 2 introduces a new `DataStore` rule, but since it is an optional addition, we will not instantiate it.

3. **Method Keyword Adjustment**:
   - In `Method`, the keyword `modifiers:` has been changed to `validators:` in Grammar 2.

Now, let's modify Instance 1 to create Instance 2 that adheres to Grammar 2:

```plaintext
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

### Modifications Made:
- Changed `Modifier` to `validator` in the declarations.
- Changed the keyword `modifiers:` to `validators:` in the `method` block.
- Ensured that all other aspects (formatting, comments, etc.) remained consistent with Instance 1.
