=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and evolve instance_1 to instance_2 following your rules:

1. Main changes needed:
   - "Modifier" keyword needs to change to "validator"
   - "modifiers:" keyword needs to change to "validators:"
   - Keep the same formatting, including white spaces, indents, and empty lines
   - No need to add DataStore instances as it's a new optional rule

2. Here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

Changes made:
1. Changed "Modifier" to "validator" in two places
2. Changed "modifiers:" to "validators:"
3. Maintained all existing formatting, including:
   - Indentation
   - Empty lines
   - Spacing
   - Line breaks
4. Did not add any DataStore instances as they are optional in grammar_2
