=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and evolve instance_1 to instance_2 following your rules.

Main changes from grammar_1 to grammar_2:
1. 'Modifier' keyword changed to 'validator'
2. 'modifiers' reference changed to 'validators' in Method rule
3. Added new optional DataStore rule (which we'll ignore as per rule 2)

Here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

        Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}

The changes made were:
1. Changed 'Modifier' to 'validator' in the two validator definitions
2. Changed 'modifiers:' to 'validators:' in the method definition
3. Maintained all formatting, including whitespace, indents, and empty lines
4. Did not add any DataStore instances as they are optional in grammar_2
