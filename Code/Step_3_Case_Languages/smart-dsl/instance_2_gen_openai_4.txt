To modify Instance 1 so that it conforms to Grammar 2, let's first analyze the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Replaced Rule:** 
   - In Grammar 2, the `Modifier` rule has been replaced by the `Validator` rule with similar structure.

2. **Additional Rule:** 
   - Grammar 2 introduces a new rule `DataStore`, which is not used in Instance 2 as per your instructions because it's optional.

3. **Change in Method:**
   - The keyword `modifiers:` in the `Method` rule has been changed to `validators:` in Grammar 2.

Now, let's reflect these changes in the instance:

```plaintext
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

The instance now follows Grammar 2. The `Modifier` rule-related sections have been changed to `Validator`, and the `modifiers:` keyword has been changed to `validators:` in the method. Optional additions from Grammar 2 such as `DataStore` are not instantiated, as instructed.
