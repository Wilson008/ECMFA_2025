Certainly! Let's first examine the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Modifiers to Validators:**
   - In Grammar 2, the `Modifier` rule has been renamed to `Validator`.
   - Methods now use `validators` instead of `modifiers`.

2. **New Grammar Rules:**
   - The `Validator` rule uses the keyword `validator` instead of `Modifier`.
   - A new rule called `DataStore` has been added, but as per your instructions, I won't instantiate it in the instance since it is either optional or part of an "OR" relationship.

With these differences in mind, we can modify Instance 1 to create Instance 2. Here's how it would look:

```plaintext
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

Key Changes Made:

- Replaced occurrences of `Modifier` with `validator`, both for declarations and references.
- Replaced `modifiers` keyword with `validators` in the `method` definition.
