To create an updated instance (Instance 2) that conforms to Grammar 2, we need to first analyze the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2. Here's a summary of the key changes and their impact on Instance 1:

### Key Differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Configuration Block**: Grammar 2 introduces a `Configuration` block at the top-level `PersistenceModel`. It includes `JavaConfiguration` and `PythonConfiguration`, but based on the instructions, we won't instantiate them since they are optional.

2. **Field and FieldDeclaration Separation**: The `Field` rule in Grammar 2 must be wrapped inside a `FieldDeclaration`, which allows for additional `TypeOptions`.

3. **Entity Field Changes**:
   - The `EntityField` now uses a cardinality symbol `|` which separates the cardinality from relationships. However, since the new attributes (bidirectional `'<->'` and unidirectional `'->'`) are in an "OR" relationship, we won't instantiate them.
   
4. **Backref Field Options**: BackrefField doesn't have additional options in Grammar 2, so no change here.

Based on these changes, here's how you can modify Instance 1 to conform to Grammar 2:

### Instance 2 (Adapted to Grammar 2):

```plaintext
Configuration [

]

entity Club {
	field property name: String [unique, not_null]

	field object [n..1] sportshall: SportsHall [not_null]

	field object [1..n] teams: Team
	field object [1..n] roles: ClubRole
	field object [1..n] sessions: TrainingSession
}

entity Team {
	field property numbering: Integer [not_null]
	field property name: String [unique]

	field object [n..1] leader: Player // UseAlter when a cyclic dependency occurs

	field object [n..m] sessions: TrainingSession

	field backref [Club.teams] club [not_null]
	field backref [Player.team] members
}

entity Player {
	field property public_id: String(100) [not_null, unique]
	field property first_name: String [not_null]
	field property last_name: String [not_null]
	field property position: Integer

	field object [1..n] information: Information
	field object [1..n] roles: ClubRole

	field object [n..1] team: Team
	field object [n..1] image: Image [not_null]
}

entity Image {
	field property path: String(200) [not_null]
	field property title: String [not_null]
}

entity Information {
	field property attribute: String [not_null]
	field property val: String [not_null]

	field backref [Player.information] player [not_null]
}

entity SportsHall {
	field property street: String [not_null]
	field property street_number: Integer [not_null]
	field property zip_code: String [not_null]
	field property place: String [not_null]
	field property country: String [not_null]
	field property state: String [not_null]

	field object [n..m] images: Image
}

entity ClubRole {
	field property name: String [not_null]

	field backref [Club.roles] club [not_null]
	field backref [Player.roles] player
}

entity TrainingSession {
	field property day: Integer [not_null]
	field property hour: Integer [not_null]
	field property minute: Integer [not_null]

	field backref [Club.sessions] club [not_null]
}
```

### Changes Made:

- Added an empty `Configuration` block at the top, as required by Grammar 2.
- Wrapped each `Field` in the `field` declaration in entities under the `field` keyword, as per the `FieldDeclaration` rule.
- Retained all the existing structure and comments from Instance 1, with no additional instantiation of new optional or OR-related attributes of Grammar 2.
