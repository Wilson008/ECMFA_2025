To transform `instance_1` into `instance_2` according to the changes from `grammar_1` to `grammar_2`, we need to account for several modifications:

1. **Configuration Block**: `grammar_2` introduces a `Configuration` block in the `PersistenceModel` before defining entities. This includes Java and Python configuration options, but since these are optional, we will not include them in the instance.

2. **Field Declaration Changes**: In `grammar_2`, fields can have options within a `FieldDeclaration`. Previously, options were directly associated with `PropertyField`, `EntityField`, and `BackrefField`.

3. **Entity Field Changes**: `EntityField` now includes optional directionality (`bidirectional` or `unidirectional`), but these too are optional, as they're described with the `|` (OR) operator. Therefore, they will not be instantiated in `instance_2`.

Given these observations, here is `instance_2`:

```plaintext
Configuration [

entity Club {
	property name: String [unique, not_null]
	[not_null]

	object [n..1] sportshall: SportsHall
	[not_null]

	object [1..n] teams: Team

	object [1..n] roles: ClubRole

	object [1..n] sessions: TrainingSession

}

entity Team {
	property numbering: Integer [not_null]
	[not_null]

	property name: String
	[unique]

	object [n..1] leader: Player // UseAlter when a cyclic dependency occurs

	object [n..m] sessions: TrainingSession

	backref [Club.teams] members
	[not_null]

	backref [Player.team] club

}

entity Player {
	property public_id: String(100) [not_null, unique]
	[not_null, unique]

	property first_name: String
	[not_null]

	property last_name: String
	[not_null]

	property position: Integer

	object [1..n] information: Information

	object [1..n] roles: ClubRole

	object [n..1] team: Team

	object [n..1] image: Image
	[not_null]

}

entity Image {
	property path: String(200)
	[not_null]

	property title: String
	[not_null]

}

entity Information {
	property attribute: String
	[not_null]

	property val: String
	[not_null]

	backref [Player.information] player
	[not_null]

}

entity SportsHall {
	property street: String
	[not_null]

	property street_number: Integer
	[not_null]

	property zip_code: String
	[not_null]

	property place: String
	[not_null]

	property country: String
	[not_null]

	property state: String
	[not_null]

	object [n..m] images: Image

}

entity ClubRole {
	property name: String
	[not_null]

	backref [Club.roles] club
	[not_null]

	backref [Player.roles] player

}

entity TrainingSession {
	property day: Integer
	[not_null]

	property hour: Integer
	[not_null]

	property minute: Integer
	[not_null]

	backref [Club.sessions] club
	[not_null]

}
```

The above instance reflects the changes required to adapt from `grammar_1` to `grammar_2` while considering the optional directionality and configuration attributes mentioned in the grammar. All items are placed in the new field declaration format.
