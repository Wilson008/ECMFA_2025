To convert `instance_1` from `Grammar 1` to `Grammar 2`, we need to identify the changes made in the grammar and adjust the instance accordingly. Here's a summary of the changes from `Grammar 1` to `Grammar 2`, and then I'll provide the modified instance `instance_2`.

### Key Differences in Grammar:
1. **Configuration Section**: `Grammar 2` introduces a `Configuration` section at the beginning of the `PersistenceModel`.
2. **FieldDeclaration Structure**: `Grammar 2` changes how options are attached to fields. In `Grammar 2`, options are part of a separate `FieldDeclaration` rule, not directly within `PropertyField` or `EntityField`.
3. **EntityField**: Adds a direction between entities (bidirectional `<->` or unidirectional `->`) in entity fields but doesn't require it to be instantiated per instruction.
4. **TypeOption on BackrefField**: The attachment of options to `BackrefField` appears not explicitly allowed in `Grammar 2`.

Based on these changes, here's `Instance_2` following `Grammar 2`:

```plaintext
Configuration [
    // If needed, configuration details can go here, but we're not instantiating them.
]

entity Club {
    property name: String [unique, not_null]
    
    object [n..1 |] sportshall: SportsHall
    [not_null]
    
    object [1..n |] teams: Team
    
    object [1..n |] roles: ClubRole
    
    object [1..n |] sessions: TrainingSession
}

entity Team {
    property numbering: Integer
    [not_null]
    
    property name: String
    [unique]
    
    object [n..1 |] leader: Player // UseAlter when a cyclic dependency occurs
    
    object [n..m |] sessions: TrainingSession
    
    backref [Club.teams] members
}

entity Player {
    property public_id: String(100)
    [not_null, unique]
    
    property first_name: String
    [not_null]
    
    property last_name: String
    [not_null]
    
    property position: Integer
    
    object [1..n |] information: Information
    
    object [1..n |] roles: ClubRole
    
    object [n..1 |] team: Team
    
    object [n..1 |] image: Image
    [not_null]
}

entity Image {
    property path: String(200)
    [not_null]
    
    property title: String
    [not_null]
}

entity Information {
    property attribute: String
    [not_null]
    
    property val: String
    [not_null]
    
    backref [Player.information] player
}

entity SportsHall {
    property street: String
    [not_null]
    
    property street_number: Integer
    [not_null]
    
    property zip_code: String
    [not_null]
    
    property place: String
    [not_null]
    
    property country: String
    [not_null]
    
    property state: String
    [not_null]
    
    object [n..m |] images: Image
}

entity ClubRole {
    property name: String
    [not_null]
    
    backref [Club.roles] club
    
    backref [Player.roles] player
}

entity TrainingSession {
    property day: Integer
    [not_null]
    
    property hour: Integer
    [not_null]
    
    property minute: Integer
    [not_null]
    
    backref [Club.sessions] club
    [not_null]
}
```

**Note**: 
1. Fields' end declaration with options (`[unique, not_null]`) are moved based on the new structure. 
2. The direction of fields using `|` in `EntityField` is added as a structure but not detailed due to instructions.
3. Configuration is recognized but left empty as specifics were not given or mandatorily instantiated.
