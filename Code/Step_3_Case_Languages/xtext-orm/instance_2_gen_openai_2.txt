To adapt Instance 1 to follow Grammar 2, let's start by identifying the key differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2 and how they impact the instance:

1. **Configuration Section:** Grammar 2 introduces a `Configuration` section within `PersistenceModel`. Each `Configuration` is optional, so we will not add any configuration for Instance 2.

2. **Entity Definition Adjustment:** In Grammar 2, `Entity` contains `fieldDeclarations` composed of `FieldDeclaration`—this includes `Field` wrapped with potential `TypeOptions`. In Instance 1, options were already defined within square brackets after each field. This overall structure remains consistent, so no change is needed for options placement.

3. **Field to FieldDeclaration:** While the rule has changed in the grammar, the overall structure in the instance remains largely the same. While the internals of `Field` have no structural changes, the move to `FieldDeclaration` doesn't impact text here.

4. **Cardinality Adjustments:** An additional syntax within `EntityField` allows for specifying directionality (e.g., bidirectional `<->` or unidirectional `->`). These choices were not originally part of Grammar 1, and per the instructions, directionality is optional. We’ll not implement them in Instance 2.

5. **BackrefField Simplification:** In the grammar, the trailing options have been removed that were appended to `BackrefField`. We will also remove any options found at the end of backref declarations, since none were originally present within Instance 1.

With these considerations, here's the modified Instance 2 reflecting Grammar 2:

```plaintext
entity Club {
	property name: String [unique, not_null]
	
	object [n..1] sportshall: SportsHall [not_null]
	
	object [1..n] teams: Team
	object [1..n] roles: ClubRole
	object [1..n] sessions: TrainingSession
}

entity Team {
	property numbering: Integer [not_null]
	property name: String [unique]
	
	object [n..1] leader: Player // UseAlter when a cyclic dependency occurs
	
	object [n..m] sessions: TrainingSession
	
	backref [Club.teams] club
	backref [Player.team] members
}

entity Player {
	property public_id: String(100) [not_null, unique]
	property first_name: String [not_null]
	property last_name: String [not_null]
	property position: Integer
	
	object [1..n] information: Information
	object [1..n] roles: ClubRole
	
	object [n..1] team: Team
	object [n..1] image: Image [not_null]
}

entity Image {
	property path: String(200) [not_null]
	property title: String [not_null]
}

entity Information {
	property attribute: String [not_null]
	property val: String [not_null]
	
	backref [Player.information] player
}

entity SportsHall {
	property street: String [not_null]
	property street_number: Integer [not_null]
	property zip_code: String [not_null]
	property place: String [not_null]
	property country: String [not_null]
	property state: String [not_null]
	
	object [n..m] images: Image
}

entity ClubRole {
	property name: String [not_null]
	
	backref [Club.roles] club
	backref [Player.roles] player
}

entity TrainingSession {
	property day: Integer [not_null]
	property hour: Integer [not_null]
	property minute: Integer [not_null]
	
	backref [Club.sessions] club
}
```

This revision aligns the instance with the updated grammar conditions, while adhering to the guidelines given (particularly regarding optional elements and maintaining original formatting).
