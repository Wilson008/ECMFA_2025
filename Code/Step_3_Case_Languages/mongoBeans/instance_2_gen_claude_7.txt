=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
After analyzing the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, the main changes are:
1. Removed 'mongobean' keyword from MongoBean rule
2. Added an optional inline MongoBean type in MongoProperty rule with an "OR" relationship

Following the rules:
1. The only change needed is to remove the 'mongobean' keyword before each bean declaration
2. We don't need to add any inline MongoBean types since it's in an "OR" relationship with the existing JvmTypeReference
3. All formatting, comments, and other elements should remain exactly the same

Here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
import java.util.*

package org.musicdb {
	/**
	 * A musical performer
	 */
	Artist {
		String name
		Album* albums
		
		Iterable<Track> getOevre() {
			albums.map[tracks].flatten
		}
	}  
	 
	/**
	 * A record, CD, DVD or another collection of tracks
	 */
	Album {
		String title
		int year 
		Track* tracks
		
		Duration getDuration() {
			tracks.map[duration].reduce[Duration a, Duration b| a + b]
		}
	}
	
	Track {
		String title
		Duration duration
	}
	
	Duration {
		int seconds
	
		void fromString(String duration) {
			val split = duration.split(':')
			seconds = Integer::parseInt(split.get(0)) * 60 + Integer::parseInt(split.get(1))
		}		
		
		String toString() {
			Integer::toString(seconds / 60) + ':' + Integer::toString(seconds % 60)
		}
		
		Duration operator_plus(Duration other) {
			new Duration() [
				seconds = this.seconds + other.seconds
			]
		}
	}
} 
```

The only change made was removing all four occurrences of the 'mongobean' keyword while preserving all other elements exactly as they were in the original instance.
