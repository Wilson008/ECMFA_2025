To modify Instance 1 to follow Grammar 2, we need to understand the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2 and see how these differences impact the existing instance.

### Differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **MongoBean Declaration:**
   - In Grammar 1, a `MongoBean` is declared with the keyword `mongobean` followed by its name and body.
   - In Grammar 2, the keyword `mongobean` is removed, and only the name and body are used.

2. **MongoProperty:**
   - In Grammar 1, `MongoProperty` only allows a type from `JvmTypeReference`.
   - In Grammar 2, `MongoProperty` can use either a `JvmTypeReference` for type or an inline `MongoBean` (but this change is not mandatory to use in the instance if it's in "OR" relation).

With these changes in mind, let's modify Instance 1 to create Instance 2 that follows Grammar 2.

### Instance 2:

```plaintext
import java.util.*

package org.musicdb {
	/**
	 * A musical performer
	 */
	Artist {
		String name
		Album* albums
		
		Iterable<Track> getOevre() {
			albums.map[tracks].flatten
		}
	}  
	 
	/**
	 * A record, CD, DVD or another collection of tracks
	 */
	Album {
		String title
		int year 
		Track* tracks
		
		Duration getDuration() {
			tracks.map[duration].reduce[Duration a, Duration b| a + b]
		}
	}
	
	Track {
		String title
		Duration duration
	}
	
	Duration {
		int seconds
	
		void fromString(String duration) {
			val split = duration.split(':')
			seconds = Integer::parseInt(split.get(0)) * 60 + Integer::parseInt(split.get(1))
		}		
		
		String toString() {
			Integer::toString(seconds / 60) + ':' + Integer::toString(seconds % 60)
		}
		
		Duration operator_plus(Duration other) {
			new Duration() [
				seconds = this.seconds + other.seconds
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Key Modifications:

- Removed `mongobean` keyword from each `MongoBean` declaration. The structure of the Instance was maintained, including comments and formatting.
- Other parts of the structure (properties and methods) remain unchanged since they conform to both versions of the grammar. 

This ensures that Instance 2 adheres to Grammar 2's rules while maintaining the original structure and intention of Instance 1.
