=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Analyzing the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2:
1. The main change is that the 'mongobean' keyword is removed from the MongoBean rule in grammar_2
2. The MongoProperty rule in grammar_2 adds an optional inline MongoBean definition (inlineType=MongoBean), but since it's in an "OR" relationship with type=JvmTypeReference, we don't need to use it as per rule #2.

Therefore, to evolve instance_1 to instance_2, we only need to remove all occurrences of the 'mongobean' keyword while keeping everything else exactly the same (including comments, whitespace, indentation, etc.).

Here's instance_2:

```
import java.util.*

package org.musicdb {
	/**
	 * A musical performer
	 */
	Artist {
		String name
		Album* albums
		
		Iterable<Track> getOevre() {
			albums.map[tracks].flatten
		}
	}  
	 
	/**
	 * A record, CD, DVD or another collection of tracks
	 */
	Album {
		String title
		int year 
		Track* tracks
		
		Duration getDuration() {
			tracks.map[duration].reduce[Duration a, Duration b| a + b]
		}
	}
	
	Track {
		String title
		Duration duration
	}
	
	Duration {
		int seconds
	
		void fromString(String duration) {
			val split = duration.split(':')
			seconds = Integer::parseInt(split.get(0)) * 60 + Integer::parseInt(split.get(1))
		}		
		
		String toString() {
			Integer::toString(seconds / 60) + ':' + Integer::toString(seconds % 60)
		}
		
		Duration operator_plus(Duration other) {
			new Duration() [
				seconds = this.seconds + other.seconds
			]
		}
	}
} 
```

The only change made was removing the 'mongobean' keyword from each bean definition while preserving all other aspects of the instance exactly as they were.
