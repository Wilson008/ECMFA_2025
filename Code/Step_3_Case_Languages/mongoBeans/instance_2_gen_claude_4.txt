=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Looking at the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2:

1. The 'mongobean' keyword is removed in grammar_2
2. MongoProperty can now have either a JvmTypeReference or an inline MongoBean as type (using |)

Following the rules you provided:
- For point 1: I need to remove all 'mongobean' keywords
- For point 2: Since the inline MongoBean is in an "OR" relationship (|) with JvmTypeReference, I won't instantiate it

Here's instance_2:

```
import java.util.*

package org.musicdb {
	/**
	 * A musical performer
	 */
	Artist {
		String name
		Album* albums
		
		Iterable<Track> getOevre() {
			albums.map[tracks].flatten
		}
	}  
	 
	/**
	 * A record, CD, DVD or another collection of tracks
	 */
	Album {
		String title
		int year 
		Track* tracks
		
		Duration getDuration() {
			tracks.map[duration].reduce[Duration a, Duration b| a + b]
		}
	}
	
	Track {
		String title
		Duration duration
	}
	
	Duration {
		int seconds
	
		void fromString(String duration) {
			val split = duration.split(':')
			seconds = Integer::parseInt(split.get(0)) * 60 + Integer::parseInt(split.get(1))
		}		
		
		String toString() {
			Integer::toString(seconds / 60) + ':' + Integer::toString(seconds % 60)
		}
		
		Duration operator_plus(Duration other) {
			new Duration() [
				seconds = this.seconds + other.seconds
			]
		}
	}
} 
```

The only change made was removing the 'mongobean' keyword from each bean definition. All other aspects, including:
- Comments
- White spaces
- Indentation
- Empty lines
- Other formatting
remain exactly the same as in instance_1.
