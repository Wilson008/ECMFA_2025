=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Analyzing the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2:
1. The main change is the removal of the 'mongobean' keyword from MongoBean rule
2. The addition of inline MongoBean type option in MongoProperty (but it's in an OR relationship with JvmTypeReference, so we won't use it)

To evolve instance_1 to instance_2, we only need to remove the 'mongobean' keyword from each MongoBean definition while keeping all other elements exactly the same (including comments, whitespace, indentation, and empty lines).

Here's instance_2:

```
import java.util.*

package org.musicdb {
	/**
	 * A musical performer
	 */
	Artist {
		String name
		Album* albums
		
		Iterable<Track> getOevre() {
			albums.map[tracks].flatten
		}
	}  
	 
	/**
	 * A record, CD, DVD or another collection of tracks
	 */
	Album {
		String title
		int year 
		Track* tracks
		
		Duration getDuration() {
			tracks.map[duration].reduce[Duration a, Duration b| a + b]
		}
	}
	
	Track {
		String title
		Duration duration
	}
	
	Duration {
		int seconds
	
		void fromString(String duration) {
			val split = duration.split(':')
			seconds = Integer::parseInt(split.get(0)) * 60 + Integer::parseInt(split.get(1))
		}		
		
		String toString() {
			Integer::toString(seconds / 60) + ':' + Integer::toString(seconds % 60)
		}
		
		Duration operator_plus(Duration other) {
			new Duration() [
				seconds = this.seconds + other.seconds
			]
		}
	}
} 
```

The only change made was removing the 'mongobean' keyword from each bean definition (Artist, Album, Track, and Duration). All other aspects of the instance, including comments, whitespace, indentation, and empty lines, remain exactly the same.
