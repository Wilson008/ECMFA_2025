To modify `instance_1` into `instance_2` based on the changes between `Grammar 1` and `Grammar 2`, we need to analyze the differences:

1. **Removal of 'mongobean' keyword**: 
   - In `Grammar 2`, the keyword 'mongobean' preceding the `MongoBean` definition has been removed.

2. **Modification in `MongoProperty`**:
   - In `Grammar 2`, a `MongoProperty` can now either be of `JvmTypeReference` or an inline `MongoBean`. This is optional and doesn't affect existing instance content since it involves a new feature that isn't part of `instance_1`.

Based on these differences, the modified instance (`instance_2`) should look like this:

```
// The imports can remain unchanged
import java.util.*

package org.musicdb {
	/**
	 * A musical performer
	 */
	Artist {
		String name
		Album* albums
		
		Iterable<Track> getOevre() {
			albums.map[tracks].flatten
		}
	}  
	 
	/**
	 * A record, CD, DVD or another collection of tracks
	 */
	Album {
		String title
		int year 
		Track* tracks
		
		Duration getDuration() {
			tracks.map[duration].reduce[Duration a, Duration b| a + b]
		}
	}
	
	Track {
		String title
		Duration duration
	}
	
	Duration {
		int seconds
	
		void fromString(String duration) {
			val split = duration.split(':')
			seconds = Integer::parseInt(split.get(0)) * 60 + Integer::parseInt(split.get(1))
		}		
		
		String toString() {
			Integer::toString(seconds / 60) + ':' + Integer::toString(seconds % 60)
		}
		
		Duration operator_plus(Duration other) {
			new Duration() [
				seconds = this.seconds + other.seconds
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Changes made:
- Removed the 'mongobean' keyword in each `MongoBean`. The rest of the structure remains intact.
- No inline `MongoBean` usage or other optional constructs are added as they are new features and not utilized in the original instance.
