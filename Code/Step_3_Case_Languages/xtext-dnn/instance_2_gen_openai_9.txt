To evolve `Instance 1` to `Instance 2` based on the differences between `Grammar 1` and `Grammar 2`, let's first identify what has changed:

**Identified Changes Between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:**

1. **Stylistic Changes:**
   - Some attributes in `Grammar 1` are snake_case, which have changed to camelCase in `Grammar 2`. These changes involve the following:
     - `image-size` has become `imageSize`
     - `image-channels` has become `imageChannels`
     - `batch-size` has become `batchSize`
     - `output-labels` has become `outputLabels`
     - `train-data-path` has become `trainDataPath`
     - `val-data-path` has become `valDataPath`
     - `caffe-path` has become `caffePath`
     - `output-path` has become `outputPath`
     - `kernel-size` has become `kernelSize`
     - `use-global-stats` has become `useGlobalStats`
     - `use-bias-term` has become `useBiasTerm`

2. **Structural Changes:**
   - In the `BranchBody`, the attribute `operation ->` now becomes `eltwiseOperation ->`.

**Modification of `Instance 1` to Create `Instance 2`:**

We will apply these changes to `Instance 1` to create `Instance 2` as follows:

```plaintext
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    caffePath = "$CAFFE_HOME"
    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: final-layer  out:labels)
}
```

**Notes on Changes:**

- All the snake_case attributes have been converted to camelCase.
- Changed `operation ->` to `eltwiseOperation ->` in the `branch` layer.
- Maintained the same formatting (e.g., whitespaces, indentations, etc.) to ensure the structure remains recognizable.
