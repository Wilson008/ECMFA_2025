=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and evolve instance_1 to instance_2 following the rules you specified.

The main changes needed are:
1. Change kebab-case to camelCase in parameter names
2. Remove 'type -> residual' in branch since BranchType is removed
3. Change 'operation' to 'eltwiseOperation' in branch
4. Change 'use-bias-term' to 'useBiasTerm'
5. Change 'use-global-stats' to 'useGlobalStats'
6. Change 'final-layer' to 'finalLayer'
7. Change other kebab-case parameter names accordingly

Here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    caffePath = "$CAFFE_HOME"
    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}
```

I've maintained all formatting, including white spaces, indents, and empty lines, while only changing the necessary elements to conform to grammar_2.
