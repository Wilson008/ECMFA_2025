To update `instance_1` from `Grammar 1` to `instance_2` to follow `Grammar 2`, let's first analyze the differences between the two grammars:

### Differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:
1. **Attribute Names Changes:**
   - `image-size` in Grammar 1 has been changed to `imageSize` in Grammar 2.
   - `image-channels` in Grammar 1 has been changed to `imageChannels` in Grammar 2.
   - `batch-size` in Grammar 1 has been changed to `batchSize` in Grammar 2.
   - `output-labels` in Grammar 1 has been changed to `outputLabels` in Grammar 2.
   - `train-data-path` in Grammar 1 has been changed to `trainDataPath` in Grammar 2.
   - `val-data-path` in Grammar 1 has been changed to `valDataPath` in Grammar 2.
   - `caffe-path` in Grammar 1 has become optional `caffePath` in Grammar 2 (not used in instance1).

2. **Attribute Inside BranchBody:**
   - In Grammar 1, the branch body has `type` and `operation` as distinct references.
   - In Grammar 2, `operation` is renamed to `eltwiseOperation`, and `type` has been removed.

3. **Naming Conventions in LayerName:**
   - `final-layer` in LayerName of Grammar 1 has been changed to `finalLayer` in Grammar 2.

Based on these differences, here is the updated `instance_2`:

```dsl
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    caffePath = "$CAFFE_HOME"
    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}
```

### Changes in instance_2:
- Updated attribute names to camel case as per Grammar 2.
- Removed `type` from within the `branch` body and updated `operation` to `eltwiseOperation`.
- Changed `final-layer` to `finalLayer` in the `LayerName` section for `dense`. 

No new attributes or optional rules were added in Grammar 2, aligning with the guidance to not instantiate optional or OR-type additions unless necessary.
