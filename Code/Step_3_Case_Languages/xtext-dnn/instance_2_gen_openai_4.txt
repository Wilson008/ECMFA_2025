In order to evolve `Instance 1` to conform to `Grammar 2`, we first need to analyze the differences between `Grammar 1` and `Grammar 2`. Here are the observed changes:

1. **Attribute Name Changes**:
   - `image-size` changed to `imageSize`.
   - `image-channels` changed to `imageChannels`.
   - `batch-size` changed to `batchSize`.
   - `output-labels` changed to `outputLabels`.
   - `caffe-path` changed to `caffePath`.
   - `use-bias-term` changed to `useBiasTerm`.
   - `use-global-stats` changed to `useGlobalStats`.
   - `kernel-size` changed to `kernelSize`.

2. **Removed Element**:
   - `type` field within `branchBody` was removed.

3. **Changed Element**:
   - `BranchBody` now uses `eltwiseOperation` instead of `operation`.

With these differences in mind, let's modify `Instance 1` to conform to `Grammar 2`:

```plaintext
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    caffePath = "$CAFFE_HOME"
    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: final-layer  out:labels)
}
```

In this conversion:
- Updated attribute names to match the new grammar: `imageSize`, `imageChannels`, `batchSize`, `outputLabels`, `caffePath`, `useBiasTerm`, `useGlobalStats`, and `kernelSize`.
- Adjusted `branch` section to use `eltwiseOperation` instead of `operation`.
- Removed `type` from the `branch` section as it is no longer defined in `Grammar 2`.
