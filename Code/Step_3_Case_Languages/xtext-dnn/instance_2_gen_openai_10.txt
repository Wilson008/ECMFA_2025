To create Instance 2, which conforms to Grammar 2, we need to analyze the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Attribute Naming and Variations:**
    - Several attribute names have been changed from using hyphens (`-`) to camelCase:
        - `batch-size` to `batchSize`
        - `image-size` to `imageSize`
        - `image-channels` to `imageChannels`
        - `output-labels` to `outputLabels`
        - `kernel-size` to `kernelSize`
        - `caffe-path` turned optional and renamed to `caffePath`  
      
2. **BranchBody Changes:**
    - The `BranchBody` no longer has a `type` field. It only contains an `eltwiseOperation`.

3. **Minor Renaming in Batch and Scale Normalization:**
    - The attribute names in `BachNormBody` and `ScaleNormBody` change from:
        - `use-global-stats` to `useGlobalStats`
        - `use-bias-term` to `useBiasTerm`

Considering these changes, here's how Instance 2 should look:

```plaintext
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}
```

Please note that:
- We have removed `caffePath` as it is now optional.
- The `type -> residual` in the branch is removed because the `type` attribute is no longer part of the branch structure.
- Fields such as `kernelSize`, `useGlobalStats`, `useBiasTerm`, and others follow camelCase styling based on Grammar 2 changes.
