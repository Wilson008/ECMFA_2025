To generate `instance_2` from `instance_1` while conforming to `grammar_2`, we need to carefully assess the differences between `grammar_1` and `grammar_2`:

### Differences between `grammar_1` and `grammar_2`:

1. **Attribute Renaming**:
   - `batch-size` is renamed to `batchSize`.
   - `image-size` is renamed to `imageSize`.
   - `image-channels` is renamed to `imageChannels`.
   - `output-labels` is renamed to `outputLabels`.
   - `train-data-path` is renamed to `trainDataPath`.
   - `val-data-path` is renamed to `valDataPath`.
   - `caffe-path` is renamed to `caffePath`.
   - `output-path` is renamed to `outputPath`.
   - `kernel-size` in `ConvLayerBody` is renamed to `kernelSize`.
   - `use-global-stats` in `BachNormBody` is renamed to `useGlobalStats`.
   - `use-bias-term` in `ScaleNormBody` is renamed to `useBiasTerm`.
   - `final-layer` in `LayerName` is renamed to `finalLayer`.

2. **Removal of `BranchType`**:
   - `type -> residual` is no longer part of the branch body syntax.

3. **Renaming in `BranchBody`**:
   - `operation -> PROD` is replaced by `eltwiseOperation -> PROD`.

### Conversion of `instance_1` to `instance_2` based on the differences:
Here is how `instance_1` would be modified to create `instance_2`:

```plaintext
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    caffePath = "$CAFFE_HOME"
    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}
```

### Summary of Changes for `instance_2`:
- Attribute names like `batch-size`, `image-size`, `image-channels`, `output-labels`, `caffe-path`, and `output-path` have been updated to their new forms.
- Inside the `ConvLayerBody`, `kernel-size` has been changed to `kernelSize`.
- Within the `BranchBody`, the statement `type -> residual` has been removed, and `operation -> PROD` has been renamed to `eltwiseOperation -> PROD`.
- Lastly, names like `use-global-stats` and `use-bias-term` have been updated to `useGlobalStats` and `useBiasTerm`, respectively. Also, `final-layer` is changed to `finalLayer`.
