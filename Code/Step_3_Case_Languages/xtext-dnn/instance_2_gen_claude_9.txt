=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll modify instance_1 according to the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, following your guidelines. Here's instance_2:

network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}

The changes I made are:
1. Changed hyphenated parameter names to camelCase:
   - 'batch-size' → 'batchSize'
   - 'image-size' → 'imageSize'
   - 'image-channels' → 'imageChannels'
   - 'output-labels' → 'outputLabels'
   - 'kernel-size' → 'kernelSize'
   - 'use-global-stats' → 'useGlobalStats'
   - 'use-bias-term' → 'useBiasTerm'

2. Removed 'caffe-path' since it's optional in grammar_2

3. Changed 'output-path' → 'outputPath'

4. In the branch section:
   - Removed 'type -> residual' since BranchType is removed in grammar_2
   - Changed 'operation' to 'eltwiseOperation'

5. Changed 'final-layer' → 'finalLayer'

I maintained all formatting, including white spaces, indentation, and empty lines from the original instance.
