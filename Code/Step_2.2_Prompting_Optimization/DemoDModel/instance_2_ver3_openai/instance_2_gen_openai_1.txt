To transform Instance 1, which follows Grammar 1, into Instance 2 that abides by Grammar 2, we need to consider the differences between the two grammar versions.

### Key Differences

1. **PackageDeclaration and Import**: Grammar 2 introduces the concepts of `PackageDeclaration` and `Import`. These are new optional elements in the grammar, so according to the provided rules, we don't need to instantiate them in the modified instance.

2. **QualifiedName**: Grammar 2 introduces `QualifiedName` to allow names to have dot-separated components. In Instance 1, names are simple identifiers without dots, so no changes are necessary.

3. **QualifiedNameWithWildcard**: Used in imports, which are not explicitly needed in our instance transformation.

4. **DataType syntax:** In Grammar 2, the `DataType` now requires a semicolon (`;`) at the end of the declaration.

5. **Entity declaration:** In Grammar 1, features in entities are separated by white spaces. In Grammar 2, features are separated by commas, which modifies the syntax within the curly braces of `Entity`.

6. **Features' default value:** Grammar 2 allows a default value for a feature using syntax like `name: Type (default)`, which is optional, so we don't need to add it.

### Transforming Instance 1 to Instance 2

```plaintext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;  // Added semicolon

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,   // Added a comma
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }  // No changes needed
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,  // Added a comma
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

### Summary of Changes

1. **Semicolon added after `datatype` declaration.**
2. **Features inside `entity` declarations now use commas as separators.**
