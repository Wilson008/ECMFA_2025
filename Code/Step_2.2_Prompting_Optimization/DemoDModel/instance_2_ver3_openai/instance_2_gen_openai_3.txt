To convert Instance 1 to Instance 2 that conforms to Grammar 2, we need to analyze the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2 and apply necessary modifications to the instance:

### Key Differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Top-level Elements:**
   - Grammar 1 has `Domainmodel` with `elements` being `Type`.
   - Grammar 2 has `Domainmodel` with `elements` being `AbstractElement`, which can be `PackageDeclaration`, `Type`, or `Import`.

2. **Packages:**
   - Grammar 2 introduces `PackageDeclaration` with a `QualifiedName` and supports nested `elements`.

3. **Qualified Names:**
   - Grammar 2 uses `QualifiedName` and allows references to be `QualifiedName`.

4. **Imports:**
   - Grammar 2 introduces `Import` with `QualifiedNameWithWildcard`.

5. **DataType:**
   - In Grammar 2, `DataType` declarations must end with a semicolon (`;`).

6. **Entities:**
   - In Grammar 2, `Entity` features are separated by commas.
   - `Entity` references can use `QualifiedName`.

7. **Features:**
   - `Feature` rule in Grammar 2 allows a default value with syntax `('(' default=ID ')')`.

With these changes noted, here's how we adjust Instance 1 to conform to Grammar 2:

### Instance 2 (Conforming to Grammar 2):

```plaintext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;  // Added semicolon

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String, // Changed to a comma-separated list
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }  // Identical structure, separated features with commas (though only one feature here)

entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

### Notes and Modifications:
- **DataType Semicolon:** Added a semicolon (`;`) after `datatype String`.
- **Comma-separated Features:** Adjusted the `Entity` blocks (`Post`, `Blog`) to have features separated by commas. Though the original document uses newline-separated features, it now accommodates the comma requirement as per the evolved grammar.
- **No Optional Elements:** No package declaration, `Import`, or default `Feature` values are added, respecting your note that optional or "OR" elements should be left uninstantiated unless required.

These changes align with the new grammar rules while maintaining the provided formatting and comments.
