To evolve Instance 1 based on the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2, let's first identify the changes:

### Differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Domainmodel:**
   - Grammar 2 introduces `AbstractElement` and allows elements to be `PackageDeclaration`, `Type`, or `Import`.

2. **PackageDeclaration:**
   - New in Grammar 2, allowing grouping of elements within a named package.

3. **QualifiedName:**
   - Introduced in Grammar 2, supporting dot-separated names.

4. **Import:**
   - New in Grammar 2 to include imported namespaces.

5. **DataType:**
   - In Grammar 2, a datatype declaration ends with a semicolon (`;`).

6. **Entity:**
   - The `extends` attribute of `Entity` now refers to `QualifiedName`, allowing more complex naming.
   - Features can be separated by commas.
   - Features can optionally have a default value in parentheses, but this is optional and won't be instantiated per instructions.

7. **Feature:**
   - The type of a feature is now a `QualifiedName`.

Given these differences, let's adapt Instance 1 to create Instance 2 so it adheres to Grammar 2:

```plaintext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String
    content: String
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

### Key Changes Made:

- The `datatype String` declaration now ends with a semicolon (`;`).
- We did not instantiate `PackageDeclaration`, `Import`, or add default values to features since they are optional.
- The spacing, indentation, comments, and overall formatting are preserved as originally given.
