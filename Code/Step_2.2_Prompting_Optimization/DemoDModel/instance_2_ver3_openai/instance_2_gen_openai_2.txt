To create an updated instance (Instance 2) that adheres to Grammar 2, we need to analyze the changes between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2. Here are the key differences:

1. **Package and Import Support**: Grammar 2 introduces package declarations and imports. However, since these are optional and not present in the original instance, we wonâ€™t add them.
  
2. **Qualified Names**: The `Entity` rule now uses qualified names for `superType`. The `Feature` rule also uses qualified names for the `type`. This change affects reference syntax but doesn't require any changes because existing references are already simple names (not affected by qualified names).

3. **DataType Terminator**: In Grammar 2, the `DataType` rule ends with a semicolon (`;`). Thus, we'll add a semicolon after `datatype String`.

4. **Feature List in Entities**: Grammar 2 allows features in entities to be separated by commas. The original format is still allowed, so no change is needed here.

5. **Default Values for Features**: Grammar 2 allows default values for features, which is optional, so we do not need to add any defaults.

Based on the analysis, the main change we need is to add the semicolon after the `DataType`. Here's the modified instance:

```plaintext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String
    content: String
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

This modified instance now adheres to Grammar 2 while keeping all formatting and content the same as the original where no changes were necessary.
