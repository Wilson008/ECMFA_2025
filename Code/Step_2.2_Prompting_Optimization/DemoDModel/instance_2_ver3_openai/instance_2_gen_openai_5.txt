To create an instance of Grammar 2 from Instance 1, we first need to identify the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2 and then adapt Instance 1 to conform to the new grammatical rules.

### Differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Namespace and Grammar Changes:**
   - The grammar's namespace declaration was updated from `org.example.domainmodel.Domainmodel` to `org.example.dmodel.evolved.DModelE`.

2. **Domainmodel Structure:**
   - `Domainmodel` now includes `PackageDeclaration` and `Import` in addition to `Type`, encapsulated under `AbstractElement`.

3. **Package Declaration:**
   - New `PackageDeclaration` rule was introduced with `QualifiedName`.

4. **Imports:**
   - New `Import` rule for imported namespaces using `QualifiedNameWithWildcard`.

5. **QualifiedName:**
   - Introduced `QualifiedName` to allow for qualified names with dots, and `QualifiedNameWithWildcard` for imports.

6. **DataType and Entity Syntax:**
   - `DataType` declaration ends with a semicolon `;`.
   - In `Entity`, features are separated by commas. 

7. **Feature Default Values and Qualified Types:**
   - `Feature` can specify default values with the syntax `('(' default=ID ')')?`, and the `type` has been extended to include `QualifiedName`.

Given these differences and the constraints you provided, here is a modified version of Instance 1, now Instance 2, according to Grammar 2:

```xtext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
    title: String ,
    many posts: Post
}

entity HasAuthor { 
    author: String 
}

entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String ,
    content: String ,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}

entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **DataType:** Added a semicolon `;` at the end of `datatype String;`.
- **Entity Features:** Added commas between features in the entities to satisfy the new entity structure with comma-separated features in Grammar 2.
- **Format:** All formatting comments and structures are preserved as per the directives. No optional or "OR" related constructs that were introduced in Grammar 2 have been instantiated, according to the instructions.
