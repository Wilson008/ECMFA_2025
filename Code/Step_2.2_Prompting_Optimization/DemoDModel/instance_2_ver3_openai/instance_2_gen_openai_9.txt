Let's first analyze the differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2:

1. **Domainmodel changes:**
   - Grammar 1 had `Domainmodel` containing just `Type` elements.
   - Grammar 2 adds `AbstractElement` which can be `PackageDeclaration`, `Type`, or `Import`.

2. **PackageDeclaration:**
   - Grammar 2 introduces `PackageDeclaration` with a `QualifiedName`. This change doesn't affect Instance 1 unless we add packages, which we won't since it's optional.

3. **QualifiedName:**
   - Grammar 2 introduces `QualifiedName` and `QualifiedNameWithWildcard`, enhancing the ability to use namespaces.

4. **Import:**
   - Introduced in Grammar 2, allows importing namespaces with `QualifiedNameWithWildcard`, but we won't use imports in this context as per your guidelines.

5. **DataType:**
   - In Grammar 2, `DataType` declarations end with a semicolon (`;`).

6. **Entity:**
   - The `extends` clause in Grammar 2 uses `QualifiedName`.
   - Features within an entity can be listed with commas in between them, although creating a single feature without commas is still valid.

7. **Feature:**
   - A default value can now be provided using parentheses `(default=ID)`.

With these differences identified, let's modify Instance 1 to follow Grammar 2, keeping the guidelines in mind:

```plaintext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
    title: String
    
    many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { 
    author: String 
}
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

**Key changes made:**
- Added `;` to the line `datatype String`.
- Added `,` between features of `Post`.
