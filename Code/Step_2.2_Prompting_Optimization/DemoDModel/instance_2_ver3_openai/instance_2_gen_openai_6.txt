To create an updated instance of the DSL that conforms to Grammar 2 based on Instance 1, we first need to analyze the differences between the two grammars:

1. **Package and Import Declarations:**
   - Grammar 2 introduces the `PackageDeclaration` and `Import` rules. However, these are optional and we're instructed not to instantiate new optional or "or" elements.

2. **Qualified Names:**
   - The entity `extends` clause and feature `type` now use `QualifiedName`. This implies that fully qualified names can be used, but using just `ID` remains valid.

3. **DataType Changes:**
   - In Grammar 2, the `DataType` definition ends with a semicolon `;`.

4. **Features in Entities:**
   - In Grammar 2, entity features can be separated by commas. However, using new optional syntax is not required.

5. **Default Values for Features:**
   - `Feature` now optionally allows a default value (`default=ID`), but using this is optional.

Now, we will modify Instance 1 to conform to Grammar 2 while adhering to the guidelines:

```plaintext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String
    content: String
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

### Key Changes:
- Added a semicolon `;` at the end of `datatype String;`. 

These changes ensure that the instance now complies with Grammar 2 while keeping all optional new features from Grammar 2 uninstantiated as instructed.
