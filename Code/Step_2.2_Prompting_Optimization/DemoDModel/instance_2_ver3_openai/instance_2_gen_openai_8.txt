To create an updated instance that adheres to Grammar 2, we must account for the differences between Grammar 1 and 2 and then apply necessary modifications to Instance 1. Here is a summary of key differences and their implications:

1. **PackageDeclaration**: Grammar 2 introduces a concept of packages, allowing elements to be organized within them. However, since this is not mandatory, we won't use it in Instance 2.
   
2. **Import**: Grammar 2 introduces an `Import` rule, but since this is optional, it will not be included in Instance 2.

3. **QualifiedName** for `Entity`: The `superType` in entities can use a qualified name for extended entities. We will consider this when modifying instance references but it's more structural for grammar.

4. **DataType**: The declaration for `DataType` now ends with a semicolon (`;`).

5. **Features**: Multiple features can optionally be separated by commas in the `Entity`.

6. **Feature default value**: Features can have an optional default value, but since this is optional, it will not be instantiated.

Applying these changes to Instance 1, we derive Instance 2:

```plaintext
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

### Notable Adjustments:

- **Semicolon for DataTypes**: Added `;` after `datatype String`.
- **Comma-Separated Features**: Introduced commas between features within entities as allowed in Grammar 2. However, for cases with comments, I preserved comment placement, being consistent with the instance's format.
  
This modified instance should align with the rules specified in Grammar 2, while honoring the constraints you've identified.
