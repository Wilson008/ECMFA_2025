=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and modify instance_1 to create instance_2 following your rules.

Main differences requiring changes in the instance:
1. DataType now requires a semicolon (';')
2. Features in Entity are now separated by commas
3. Other changes (packages, imports, etc.) are optional, so we won't add them

Here's instance_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after 'datatype String'
2. Added commas between features in entities where multiple features exist:
   - In Blog: between 'title' and 'posts'
   - In Post: between 'title', 'content' and 'comments'
   - No comma needed in HasAuthor and Comment as they only have one feature

All formatting, comments, and whitespace remain exactly the same as in instance_1.

Note: Optional elements from grammar_2 (packages, imports, qualified names, default values) were not added as per your first rule.
