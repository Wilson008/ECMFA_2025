=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and create instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2 while following your requirements.

Main changes needed for instance_2:

1. The `DataType` rule now requires a semicolon (';') at the end
2. In `Entity` rule, features need to be comma-separated by commas

Since Package and Import are optional new rules (requirement 1), we won't add them.

Here's instance_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after `datatype String`
2. Added commas between features in entities with multiple features (Blog and Post)
3. Preserved all comments, white spaces, and formatting exactly as in instance_1
4. Did not add any optional new elements like packages or imports

All other aspects of the instance remain unchanged as they were already compatible with grammar_2.
