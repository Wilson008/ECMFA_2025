=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and modify instance_1 according to grammar_2, following your guidelines.

Main differences that affect the instance:
1. `DataType` now requires a semicolon (';')
2. `Entity` features are now separated by commas
3. New elements like Package, Import, and QualifiedNames are optional, so we won't add them

Here's the modified instance (instance_2):

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after `String` in the datatype declaration
2. Added commas between features in entities that have multiple features:
   - In `Blog`: between `title` and `many posts`
   - In `Post`: between `title`, `content`, and `many comments`

Preserved:
1. All comments (both block and line comments)
2. All whitespace, indentation, and empty lines
3. All existing structures and relationships
4. Did not add any optional new elements from grammar_2

Note: The last feature in each entity doesn't need a comma according to the grammar_2's specification.
