=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and modify instance_1 to create instance_2 following your guidelines.

Main differences requiring changes in the instance:
1. DataType now requires a semicolon (';')
2. Features within Entity are now separated by commas
3. New elements (Package, Import) are optional, so we won't add them
4. Qualified names are now supported but not mandatory, so we'll keep simple names

Here's instance_2 following grammar_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after 'datatype String'
2. Added commas between features in entities that have multiple features (Blog and Post)
3. Preserved all comments, whitespace, and formatting exactly as in instance_1
4. Did not add any optional new elements (packages, imports)

Everything else remains the same as the original instance since other grammar changes (like qualified names) are optional and don't require modifications to the existing instance.
