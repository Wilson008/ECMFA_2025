=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and modify instance_1 to conform to grammar_2 while following your requirements.

Main differences in grammar_2 that affect the instance:
1. DataType rule now requires a semicolon (';')
2. Entity features are now separated by commas (optional)
3. Features can have default values (optional - we won't add as per requirement 1)
4. Package and Import features (optional - we won't add as per requirement 1)

Here's instance_2, modified to conform to grammar_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after 'datatype String'
2. Added commas between features in entities with multiple features (Blog and Post)
3. Preserved all comments, whitespace, indentation, and empty lines exactly as in instance_1
4. Did not add any optional elements from grammar_2 (packages, imports, default values)

Note that the last feature in each entity block doesn't need a comma, so I didn't add them there.
