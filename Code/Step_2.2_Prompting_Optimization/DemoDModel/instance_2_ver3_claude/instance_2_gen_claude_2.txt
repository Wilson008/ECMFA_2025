=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and create instance_2 based on the rules you provided.

Main differences requiring changes in the instance:
1. DataType rule now requires a semicolon (';')
2. Entity features are now separated by commas
3. Package declaration, Import and other new rules are optional, so we won't add them

Here's instance_2 following grammar_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after 'datatype String'
2. Added commas between features in entities (Blog and Post)
3. Preserved all comments, whitespace, indentation, and empty lines exactly as in instance_1
4. Did not add any optional elements from grammar_2 (packages, imports, etc.)

Note that the last feature in each entity doesn't need a comma, as per the grammar rule: `(features+=Feature  (',' features+=Feature)*)?`
