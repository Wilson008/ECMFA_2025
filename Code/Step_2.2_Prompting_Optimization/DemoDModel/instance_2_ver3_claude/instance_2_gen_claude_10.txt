=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences between the grammars and modify instance_1 to conform to grammar_2 while following your requirements.

Key differences that require changes in the instance:
1. DataType rule now requires a semicolon (;)
2. Features within Entity are now comma-separated (with commas between features)

According to your requirements:
1. I won't add new optional elements like packages, imports, or default values for features
2. I'll maintain all existing comments, whitespace, and formatting

Here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after 'datatype String'
2. Added commas between features in entities that have multiple features (Blog and Post)
3. Preserved all comments, empty lines, and formatting exactly as in the original
4. Did not add any optional new elements from grammar_2
