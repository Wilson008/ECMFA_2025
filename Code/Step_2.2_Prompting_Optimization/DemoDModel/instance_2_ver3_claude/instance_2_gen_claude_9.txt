=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences and modify instance_1 to create instance_2 following your guidelines.

Main differences requiring changes:
1. DataType rule in grammar_2 requires a semicolon after the ID
2. Entity features in grammar_2 need to be comma-separated

The modified instance (instance_2) should be:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after "String" in the datatype declaration
2. Added commas between features in entities where multiple features exist (Blog and Post)

Notes:
1. I didn't add any package declarations or imports (new optional features in grammar_2)
2. Maintained all original comments, whitespace, and formatting
3. Single-feature entities (HasAuthor and Comment) don't need commas
4. Kept all original empty lines and indentation
