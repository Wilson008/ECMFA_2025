=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences between the grammars and modify instance_1 to create instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2, following your guidelines.

Main differences requiring changes in the instance:
1. DataType rule now requires a semicolon (';')
2. Entity features are now separated by commas

Here's instance_2 following grammar_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after 'datatype String'
2. Added commas between features in entities with multiple features (Blog and Post)
3. Preserved all comments, whitespace, indentation, and empty lines exactly as in instance_1
4. Did not add any optional new elements (package declarations, imports, etc.)

Note that single-feature entities (HasAuthor and Comment) don't require a comma as they only have one feature.
