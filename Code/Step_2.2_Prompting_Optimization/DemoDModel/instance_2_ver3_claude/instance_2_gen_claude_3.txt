=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
I'll analyze the differences between the grammars and modify instance_1 to create instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2, following your guidelines.

Main differences in grammar_2 that affect instance conversion:
1. DataType rule now requires a semicolon (';')
2. Features in Entity are now optionally separated by commas
3. New optional and alternative elements (PackageDeclaration, Import, QualifiedName) - which we'll skip per your instruction #1

Here's instance_2, modified to conform to grammar_2:

```
/**
 * This is the example before the evolution.
 * This is the header.
 * */
datatype String;

/* this is the first comment, added by me */
entity Blog {
	title: String,
	many posts: Post
}
 
entity HasAuthor { author: String }
 
entity Post extends HasAuthor {
    title: String,
    content: String,
    //many comment: Comment
    many comments: Comment
}
 
entity Comment extends HasAuthor {
    content: String // this is the second comment, added 2025-01-01
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added semicolon after `datatype String`
2. Added commas between features in entities where multiple features exist
3. Preserved all comments, whitespace, indentation, and empty lines exactly as in instance_1
4. Did not add any optional new elements from grammar_2 (packages, imports, etc.)

Note that all other formatting, including comments, empty lines, and indentation, remains identical to instance_1.
